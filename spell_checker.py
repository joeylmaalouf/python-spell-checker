# -- check for any incorrect words ---------------------------------------------

# our acceptable list nor a pure number, add it to the list of incorrect words.
# This way, we can mark both 'phone' and '75' as correct, but not 'phone75'.

# add it; if it is, then it's a duplicate and we don't care about it.

# -- print out our final output ------------------------------------------------

# as its numerical index (position) in the input file.
